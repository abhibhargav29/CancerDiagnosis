Predicting type of cancer using gene, variation and text related to that particular variation in that gene. We have used one_hot encoding and response coding for gene and 
variation features and tf-idf weighted bag of words for the test feature vectorization. Finally we built our models and plotted their confusion matrices with heatmap.
