# CancerDiagnosis

Predicting type of cancer using gene, variation and text related to that particular variation in that gene.

We have used one_hot encoding and response coding for gene and variation features and tf-idf bag of words for the test feature vectorization. Finally we built model and plotted 
their confusion matrices with heatmap.
